# Welcome to the PaperPods Project!

## What is PaperPods?

PaperPods is an exciting and user-friendly web application that allows you to create fun and engaging podcasts from your selected research papers. Whether you're an academic, a researcher, or someone passionate about a specific topic, PaperPods offers a unique and innovative way to share knowledge and ideas. The process is simple and straightforward. First, you start by defining your podcast name, giving it a distinct identity. Next, you have the freedom to choose the host name and customize the voice, tailoring the podcast's personality to your liking. Additionally, you can determine the explanation level, making sure the content is suitable for the intended audience, whether it's kids, teenagers, or adults. Once you have the podcast's foundational elements in place, you can effortlessly upload your research paper to the platform. This is where the magic happens: PaperPods employs an advanced AI engine powered by GPT to analyze and process the research paper's content. The AI engine efficiently transforms the technical jargon and complex concepts into easily understandable language, ensuring that your podcast remains accessible and enjoyable to a broad audience. To further enhance the listening experience, PaperPods collaborates with the cutting-edge ElevenLabs TTS engine. This powerful text-to-speech technology converts the transformed content into a natural and engaging audio format, complete with human-like intonations and expressions. The result is a seamless and dynamic podcast that captivates listeners, taking them on an informative and entertaining journey through the world of research and academia.
